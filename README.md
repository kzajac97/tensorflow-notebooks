# TensorFlow Notebooks

This repository contains various *Google Colab* notebooks with
sophisticated machine learning models used for different tasks.

*time-series-analysis.ipynb* <br>
Contains analysis of weather data using various models
for sequence prediction tasks

*convolutional-autoencoder.ipynb* <br>
Contains implementation of convolutional variational autoencoder 
using MNIST data set.
